# ft_services
Fucking services I guess.

Nope.
## Requirements
a **kubernetes web dashboard**, a **load balancer**, **WordPress** open on port **5050**, with a **MySQL** database each in a different fucking containers, **phpMyAdmin** of course this is what I fucking needed to fucking kill myself. **WordPress and phpMyAdmin** will both have their own fucking **nginx server**.

## The fuck is Kubernetes
Helps manage clustered groups of hosts running Linux containers, I guess.
### Clusters
*stolen from **https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/create-cluster/cluster-intro/***

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two types of resources:

The **Master** coordinates the cluster, **Nodes** are the workers that run applications (VM or a physical computer that serves as a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster).

A Kubernetes cluster can be deployed on either physical or virtual machines. To get started with Kubernetes development, you can use Minikube. Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes implementation that creates a VM on your local machine and deploys a simple cluster containing only one node. 

*So Kubernetes is fucking classist too, kill me.*
